# MKS22X-FinalProject
Final Project Second Semester

Description:
This is a basic Tetris game. A random shape falls from the top of the screen and the user decides where to place it. The objective of the game is to get a whole row filled with pieces without gaps and the user does this by moving the pieces left or right or rotating them. Once the row is filled, it is erased and the score increases. The game ends once the pieces stack to the top of the screen.

Features:
The game is played with the arrow keys. The left key moves the pieces to the left and the right key moves them to the right. The up arrow is used to rotate the piece and the down arrow is used to move the pieces down at a faster rate. The score is shown on the right side of the screen and the user is also able to see the next piece that will fall down.
